  - In 2020, we experienced exceptional growth, surpassing expectations with a $10.2M increase in revenue (+300% YoY), AOV rising to $300 (+81% YoY), and a total orders reaching 11k (+86% YoY).
  - However since the beginning of 2021 we saw a gradual decline across metrics with revenue down 11% and our AOV 15% despite an orders increase of 6%. This downward trend continued in 2022 with a 46% decline in revenue with other metrics following a similar trajectory.
  - Our Loyalty Program has been showing strong performance. Initially non-subscribers contributed the majority of revenue and orders. However, between Q1 2021 and Q3 2022, subscriber base grew significantly, surpassing non-subscribed users across key metrics.
  - Apple products accounted for 50% of total sales, with the iPhone having the lowest sales volume but a high AOV. Targeted marketing for high-AOV, low-volume products through bundle promotions could drive significant revenue growth.
